# Garage Door State Monitor

Ever leave your garage door open when you leave the house, only to come home later and find it open? Of course you have! I've done it numerous times, so I decided to come up with something to allow me to remotely check the status of the door and close it if I need to. It can also work as a phone-based secure remote control! 

It uses the Blynk app for monitoring and control and a SparkFun ESP8266 Thing IoT board, coupled with a MOSFET "relay" that allows us to tap into the wired button in your garage. I used simple magnetic reed switches mounted on the door rails to determine if it's open or closed. 

Never leave your car hole open accidentally again!
